Sports is an important part of any country. It is something that is equally popular amongst all sections of the society.
It will not be wrong to say that sports is one activity that binds people and brings them together. 
A lot of people passionately follow sports in our country.
Naturally, as more and more things become accessible online, there has been a demand to make viewing sports, also as online an activity.
This application focuses on getting the scores of all cricket matches being played live, around the world as well as performing many other functionalities
expected in a live scores application.
This app reduces the dependency of cricket fans on news channels to follow their favorite matches, and brings a consolidated view of all the matches,
in a single place. The application has been built as an Android Studio application and uses Java language for backend, as well as the Firebase database.
The implementation of this application will be of significant use to the followers as well as those who are new to cricket sport, alike.
